# lora_detector_change_distance
This detector serves for detection changing distance between device and gateway. Detection is for fixed-position devices, if the attacker transfers the device, the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) changes. This may vary depending on the environment, such as weather. Therefore, it is possible to set the deviation for RSSI.
